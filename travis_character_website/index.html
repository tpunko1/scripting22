		<p>Lelouch is a complicated character with many faces. To most, he is Lelouch Lamperouge, the vice president of the student council and genius peer of the group that wastes his time on gambling. To others, he is Zero, the leader of the rebellion seeking free Japan from the fist of Britannia. And too few, he is Lelouch vi Britannia, the banished prince, thought to be died, hiding from the world to later reappear as the 99th Emperor of Holy Britannia Empire.</p>
		
		<p>To assist him with his ambitions, an immortal witch bestowed him with the power of the king, Geass. In his case the power of absolute obedience, where he can command anyone to do anything if he makes direct eye contact. Granting him the ability to further his goals of each mask. </p>

	<section>
		<h2 id="MM">Making of the Mask</h2>
		
		<div>
			<h3><b>Mask of Zero</b></h3>
			<p>Lelouch despised Britannia ever since his banishment and wanted revenge. After acquiring his Geass powers, he was able to gain the trust of the local resistance groups in Japan with his “miracles,” later forming the Black Knights.</p>
		
			<p class="quote"><i>"People don’t give a damn about reasons, but nobody can resist miracles."</i><br>- Zero</p>
			
		</div>
		
		<div>
			<h3><b>Mask of a Student</b></h3>
			<p>Banished to Japan at the age of 10 with his blind younger sister they were “hostages” of the Kyoto House, thought to have died in the war between Britannia and Japan. However, they lived on, changing their last name to Lamperouge. Starting a new life.</p>
		
			<p class="quote"><i>“Ever since that day, I have lived a lie, the lie of living.”</i><br>- Lelouch Lamperouge</p>
			
		</div>
	
		<div>
			<h3><b>Mask of Royalty</b></h3>
			<p>Born the 11th prince of Britannia, he was 17th in line for the throne. However, after the murder of his mom, he called out to his father for not protecting her and from banished for his insolence. Lelouch hides his royal state till later in his life.</p>

	<section class="alternate">
		<h2 id="PM">Purpose of the Mask</h2>
		
		<div>
			<h3><b>Role of the Student</b></h3>
			<p>Lelouch’s mask as a student was mainly to hide Nunnally, his sister, and his royal states from others and because the government won’t think a student could be the leader of the Black Knights. He doesn’t use this Geass much as a student, only to cover up evidence of him being Zero. His mask as a student has an important part of the first half of season two while being under close surveillance by the Government.</p>
			
		</div>
		
		<div>
			<h3><b>Forgotten Prince</b></h3>
			<p>Lelouch’s Royal states is only known by a few, most however who know think he is dead or are dead themselves. This mask is not seen a lot in the first season, though plays a major role at the end of season two when he proclaims himself Emperor after finally killing him.</p>

	<section class="alternate">
		<h2 id="FT">The Final Theatre</h2>
		
		<div>
			<h3><b>Zero's Final Stage</b></h3>
			<p>Zero stood as a symbol of hope for the Japanese people. However, when Black Knight leadership learned that Zero was Lelouch, a Britannia prince, as well as his Geass power that was used on their own members, they planned a Coup d'état. After near escaping death and losing his army of knights to fight Britannia, Lelouch sought out a new way to achieve his goals. Later Zero, under the reins of Suzaku, appeared for one last hurrah.</p>
			
			<p class="quote"><i>“You can’t change the world without getting your hands dirty”</i><br>- Zero</p>
			
		</div>
		
		<div>
			<h3><b>Face Revival</b></h3>
			<p>After Lelouch decided the best way to create the world he wanted was to become the very thing he sought to destroy, he had to drop his student mask. Once he proclaimed himself Emperor it was all out in the open and everyone saw the truth.</p>
		
			<p class="quote"><i>“You must think your pretty cool huh, just playing the critic and judging the world from the sidelines.”</i><br>- Kallen Kōzuki</p>
			
		</div>
	
		<div>
			<h3><b>Lelouch's Final Act</b></h3>
			<p>After losing everything, Lelouch's last option was to become Emperor and destroy this world he hated, to become a devil for the world to hate. To create a world of peace all he would have to do is put all the world’s hate in one place and destroy it, and who better to bring the Demon Emperor Lelouch to justice than Zero.</p>
